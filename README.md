Course Description 
Game   theory   is   a   structured   way   to   think   about   strategic   interactions   and   it   is   fundamental   to   the   understanding of modern business strategy. In this course, you will be introduced to the basic tools   of   Game   Theory   and   its   applications   to   business   choices. We   will   cover   normal   form   and extensive   form   games, games   of   perfect   and   imperfect/incomplete   information, and   will introduce equilibrium concepts such as Nash Equilibrium, Subgame-Perfect   Equilibrium and Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium. We will also look at   repeated games   and the theory of   reputation.   Game   Theory   will   not   only   equip   you   with   an   understanding   of   the   basic   principles   of   strategic analysis   but   also   empower   you   to   integrate   ethical   and   sustainable   considerations   into   the application   of   abstract   theory   to   specifc   real-world   business   challenges.
Course Aims 
ECON2112 is offered as part of the economics stream in the   BCom and   BEc   degrees.
Prerequisites for this course are ECON1101 Microeconomics 1   (or   COMM1100) and   ECON1202   Quantitative Analysis for Business and Economics. This course aims to build on basic theories      and knowledge learnt in these prior courses. The knowledge acquired   in this course   is further developed and used in third-year courses including ECON3121   Managerial   Economics   and ECON3123 Organisational Economics among others. The course is useful for   students   in   Mathematics  Statistics, Computer Science and Engineering, especially those who are interested in   Data Science.
